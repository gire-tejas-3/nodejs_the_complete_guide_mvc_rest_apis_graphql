/**
    Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response 
    object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next 
    function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware 
    succeeding the current middleware.

    Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

    - Execute any code.
    - Make changes to the request and the response objects.
    - End the request-response cycle.
    - Call the next middleware in the stack.
    - If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must 
        call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the 
        request will be left hanging.
